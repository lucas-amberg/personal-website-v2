# Personal Website v2

New &amp; Improved Personal Portfolio Site

## Why did I make this?

After ignoring my [old portfolio website](https://github.com/lucas-amberg/personal-website) while focusing on other things, I feel now is the time to revisit it and apply some new technologies I have learned since then. 

## What is there to improve?

I made my old site before I learned Next.js, it is built with Vanilla CSS, React.js, and Express. My main issue with it is the inconsistencies in styling across different screen sizes and devices. This is a difficult fix considering the styling is not centralized whatsoever and is spread across several css files. Nowadays this is an unacceptable practice to me, especially for a site as small as this. I believe moving to Next.js and CSS in JS frameworks will streamline the development and design of the site, as well as prevent a remake in the future.

## Tasks to complete

This is mostly for myself to reference as I complete the site, just to have a good priorities list and order of development.
